This repository is for testing cvs2svn's choices of which directories
to copy when filling symbolic names.  The layout is:

     /one
      two
      three
      /sub1/four
            five
            six
            sub2/seven
                 eight
                 nine
                 ten

Every file was imported in a standard way, then revisions 1.2 and 1.3
were committed on every file.  Then a branch was made:

    BRANCH_1: sprouts from every file's 1.3 (so branch number 1.3.0.2)

Then a revision was committed on that branch, creating revision
1.3.2.1 on every file.  Next a branch was made from that revision, on
every file:

    BRANCH_2: sprouts from every file's 1.3.2.1 (so branch number 1.3.2.1.0.2)

The rest of the branches below all sprout from either trunk, or from
the first revision on BRANCH_1 (that is, from 1.3.2.1), in various
combinations.  Every branch below exists on every file, the only
question is where the branch is rooted for each file.

    BRANCH_3: Sprouts from trunk everywhere except sub1/sub2/*, where
              it sprouts from BRANCH_1 for all four files.

    BRANCH_4: Sprouts from trunk everywhere except for sub1/sub2/ten,
              where it sprouts from BRANCH_1.  Note that this is a
              clear minority in sub1/sub2/, since it still sprouts
              from trunk on the other three files there ('seven',
              'eight', and 'nine').

    BRANCH_5: Sprouts from trunk everywhere except for sub1/sub2/nine
              and sub1/sub2/ten, where it sprouts from BRANCH_1.  This
              is an even division in sub1/sub2, since it sprouts from
              trunk on two files ('seven' and 'eight') and from BRANCH
              one on the other two ('nine' and 'ten').

    BRANCH_6: Sprouts from trunk everywhere except for
              sub1/sub2/eight, sub1/sub2/nine, and sub1/sub2/ten,
              where it sprouts from BRANCH_1.  This is a clear
              majority in favor of BRANCH_1, since BRANCH_6 sprouts
              from trunk on only one file ('seven') and from BRANCH_1
              on the other three ('eight', 'nine' and 'ten').

    BRANCH_7: Sprouts from trunk everywhere except sub1/five and
              sub1/six, where it sprouts from BRANCH_1.  This is a
              majority in favor of BRANCH_1 there, as the only other
              file in that directory is 'four', but note that both the
              parent directory and the sole subdirectory are majority
              from trunk.

    BRANCH_8: The reverse of BRANCH_7.  Sprouts from BRANCH_1
              everywhere except sub1/five and sub1/six, where it
              sprouts from trunk.  This is a majority in favor of
              trunk there, as the only other file in that directory
              is 'four', but note that both the parent directory and
              the sole subdirectory are majority from BRANCH_1.
