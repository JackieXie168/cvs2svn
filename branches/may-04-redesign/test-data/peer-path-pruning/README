This repository is for testing cvs2svn's pruning choices when filling
symbolic names.  The layout is:

     /one.txt
      two.txt
      /foo/three.txt
           four.txt
      /bar/five.txt
           six.txt

Every file was imported in a standard way, then revisions 1.2 and 1.3
were committed on every file.  Then a branch was made:

    BRANCH_1: sprouts from every file's 1.3 (so branch number 1.3.0.2)

Then a revision was committed on that branch, creating revision
1.3.2.1 on every file.

More to come...
